What is machine learning (ML)?
---
- Conventional computer algorithms solve problems with explicit instructions
- ML solves problems without explicit instructions
  - using generalizable statistical algorithms
  - based on mathematical optimization


ML is a subfield of AI
---
- <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/AI_hierarchy.svg" alt="ML in AI" style="width:400px;height:auto;">
- ML contains the contemporary hot field Deep Learning (DL)
- Data mining overlaps many topics of ML, but focusing on exploring data patterns through unsupervised learning


ML typical problems
---
- classification: identifies which category an object belongs to
  - image recognition, credit card frauds
- regression: predicts a continuous-valued quantity in a phenomena
  - weather prediction, stock price prediction
- clustering: groups similar objects into sets
  - market segmentation, mushroom categorizing
- dimensionality reduction: finds the key features or factors of a problem
  - feature selection, principal component analysis (PCA)


ML learning methods classified by generalization
---
- Instance-based
  - remembers the examples
  - generalize to new cases by comparing them to the learned examples
    - by measuring their similarity
- Model-based
  - builds a general model of the examples


ML learning methods classified by supervision
---
- Supervised learning
  - the ML model is trained with example inputs and desired outputs
  - the goal is to learn a _general rule_ that maps inputs to outputs
- Unsupervised learning
  - only example inputs are given to the ML model
  - the goal is to discover _patterns or structures_ in the inputs
- Semisupervised learning
  - a combination of 
    - supervised learning finds the pattern
    - and unsupervised learning names or labels the pattern
- Reinforcement learning
  - a set of environment, actions and rewards are given to the RL model or agent
  - the goal is to learn _an optimal policy_ that maximizes rewards


ML models
---
- architectures with trainable or adjustable parameters
- popular ML models
  - Artificial neural networks (ANNs)
  - Decision trees
  - Support-vector machines
  - Regression analysis
  - Bayesian networks
  - Gaussian processes
  - Genetic algorithms
  - Belief functions

Model training
---
- searches for an _optimal value for the model parameters_
  - that the model will _generalize_ well to new data
- minimizes a cost function that measures the model prediction accuracy
- applies a regularizer to constrain the model complexity
- Batch learning
  - trained with all the available offline data
  - also called offline learning
  - needs to be trained again for new data sets
- Online learning
  - trained incrementally with mini-batches of data
  - adapts to change rapidly and autonomously


ML challenges
---
- Insufficient quantity of training data
  - Poor-quality data
- Nonrepresentative training data
  - Irrelevant features
  - Data mismatch between training and production environment
- Overfitting the training data with complex models
  - performs great on the training data but poorly on new data
- Underfitting the training data with simple models
  - performs poorly on both the training data and new data
